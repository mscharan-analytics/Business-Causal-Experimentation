Collaboration Insights : Exploring the Impact of Collaboration on Learning Performance

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The project aims to investigate the impact of group study versus individual study on performance among students. Specifically, it seeks to determine whether studying in groups leads to better performance compared to studying individually, or if there's no significant difference between the two approaches.


## MOTIVATION

In educational settings, students often employ different study methods, including group study and individual study. Understanding which approach yields better outcomes can help educators and students optimize their study strategies.
The project addresses a gap in the existing literature by providing empirical evidence on the effectiveness of group study versus individual study, contributing valuable insights to educational practices.
By identifying the most effective study approach, the project aims to enhance student learning experiences and academic success, ultimately benefiting both students and educational institutions.

## Methodology 
### Participants
We designed an experiment in which 75 participants were divided into individual learners as the control group and collaborative groups as the treatment groups. The control group consisted of 25 participants who worked individually, while the treatment group had 50 participants who worked in pairs, forming 25 groups.

### Procedure
All participants were required to watch the same 5-minute YouTube video titled "27 Facts That Will Make You Question Your Existence", which was related to space and astronomy1. In the subsequent section, they needed to complete a quiz consisting of 15 questions: 5 easy, 5 moderate, and 5 hard difficulty levels, assessing comprehension of the interesting facts presented in the video. During this section, collaborative groups worked together to answer the post-assessment quiz, while individual groups completed the same quiz independently. The time spent on the quiz was also tracked for all participants. Moreover, we also displayed a 20-minute countdown timer on the screen so that participants could see how much time they spent on the quiz. However, we did not impose a strict time limit, allowing groups to work on the quiz for more than 20 minutes if needed. We will use this information as part of our analysis variables.



### Conclusions 
In this experiment, we aimed to assess whether group study outperforms individual study. Our focus was on measuring participants' scores on a quiz related to a cosmic YouTube video. The experiment was designed using a Google Form, which included demographic information and questions about the video content. Participants were randomly assigned to either the group study or individual study treatment.
Although our study did not provide conclusive evidence that collaboration is definitively more effective than individual work in learning, we observed a trend towards improved performance, especially on more challenging questions, in the collaborative group. This trend suggests the potential benefits of collaborative learning but warrants further investigation.
Future research could address the limitations identified in this study by employing larger sample sizes, exploring different learning materials and assessment formats, and incorporating objective pre-assessment measures. Understanding the nuances of collaboration in learning contexts can inform educational practices and enhance both individual and collective knowledge acquisition.
